How to compile WebApp

So assume we had created up a machine learning webapp here.

For all the beginners and new comers, how project structure works and how to compile it

Every project should have these basic files for running a webapp

Create a prediction file for any project you are interested to work on

Deploy it in a model and generate a .pkl file using the algorithm which provides good accuracy

Now, add up .pkl file and .ipynb file 

Create requirements.txt file with all the libraries used

Add the dataset file you had used for prediction

To make it in web app, we need 3 files most importantly. That is "app.py", "Procfile" and "index.html"

Here in Procfile, we added the format of how webapp should look

We had added up index.html in "templates" folder. "index.html" file is the face of webapp where we write a front end programming with head, body and footer section

Finally, we deploy it in flask to run the project in browser mode.


To run this project

first clone the project, go to project repo

now we will : run requirements.txt

Once all libraries are installed as given in "requirements.txt" file, we will run our app. 

For it, we shall do : run app.py

This would run the webapp in the ip address given in a browser mode

Thank you, hope you understood how webapp works and it can be compiled successfully.
